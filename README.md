# `CI Foundry`

> [!NOTE] 
> This document provides an overview of the testing strategy for the `foundryup.sh` script in the CI/CD environment.


Non-Interactive Design: The script now assumes it is running in a CI/CD environment, thus ensuring it can run without human interaction.

Consistent Logging: Ensures all log messages are consistent and CI-friendly.
Automatic Directory Creation: Automatically creates necessary directories and ensures no manual intervention is required.

Simplified Argument Parsing: Simplified argument parsing to make it more robust for automated environments.

Error Handling: Enhanced error handling to ensure the script fails fast and provides meaningful error messages for debugging in CI/CD logs.


### Steps for Creating Tests

1. **Basic Command Execution**:
   - Ensure essential commands like `git`, `curl`, and `cargo` are called.
   
2. **Argument Parsing**:
   - Test with different combinations of arguments to verify proper parsing.
   
3. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure environment variables and directories are set up correctly.
   
4. **Platform and Architecture Handling**:
   - Verify correct handling of different platforms and architectures.
   
5. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensure proper error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or failures.
   
6. **File and Directory Operations**:
   - Test file and directory creation, deletion, and symlinking operations.
   
7. **Function Output Verification**:
   - Verify output of functions like `say`, `warn`, and `err`.
   
8. **Binary Installation**:
   - Ensure binaries are downloaded and installed correctly.
   
9. **Local Repository Installation**:
   - Verify installation from a local repository.
   
10. **Help Message**:
    - Ensure the help message is displayed correctly.


### Explanation of Each Test

1. **Basic Command Execution**:
   - Tests that `git` and `curl` commands are called during the script execution.

2. **Argument Parsing**:
   - Ensures the script handles unknown options correctly and displays an appropriate warning message.

3. **Environment Setup**:
   - Tests that `cd` and `cargo` commands are called when installing from a local repository.

4. **Platform and Architecture Handling**:
   - Verifies the script handles platform and architecture correctly.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensures the `ensure` function fails correctly when a command fails.
   - Tests that `warn`, `say`, and `err` functions display messages correctly.

6. **Help Message**:
   - Ensures the help message is displayed correctly with the `--help` option.

These tests cover various aspects of the script to ensure it works correctly in a CI/CD environment.
